Table 23 provides the dose conversion factors for the total effective dose to the representative person
and the total equivalent dose to the fetus for the ‘ground’ scenario (needed in the calculation of
OIL1 γ and OIL2 γ ), over an exposure period ∆ of 7 days and 1 year. 41 These dose conversion factors
are determined as described in Sections 3.6.1.1 and 3.6.1.2.
3.6.1.1. Total effective dose to the representative person for the ‘ground’ scenario
Table 23 provides E grd-scenario,i (∆) [Sv/(Bq/m 2 )], which is the total effective dose to the representative
person over an exposure period ∆ 41 for the ‘ground’ scenario, per unit ground surface activity of
radionuclide i. It is determined by Eq. (22):
